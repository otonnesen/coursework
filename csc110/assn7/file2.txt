Space	31	 she knows
Hero	28	 And the guns shot above our heads
Space	15	 if you dare
Change	18	 But I can't trace time
Change	4	 It seemed the taste was not so sweet
Space	20	 And the stars look very different today
Space	26	 Though I'm past 
Change	52	 I said that time may change me
Hero	24	 We can be Heroes, just for one day
Change	51	 But I can't trace time
Hero	23	 Though nothing will drive them away
Hero	4	 We can be Heroes, just for one day
Space	17	 I'm stepping through the door
Space	4	 Ground Control to Major Tom
Space	32	 Ground Control to Major Tom
Change	26	 Are immune to your consultations
Space	5	 Commencing countdown, 
Change	40	 Changes are taking the pace
Hero	12	 We can be Heroes, for ever and ever
Change	50	 Time may change me
Space	35	 Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Change	13	 Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Hero	18	 We can beat them, for ever and ever
Space	43	 And there's nothing I can do.
Hero	38	 We can be Heroes
Change	19	 I watch the ripples change their size
Change	2	 A million dead-end streets
Space	22	 Am I sitting in a tin can
Hero	17	 nothing will keep us together
Space	18	 And I'm floating 
Space	25	 And there's nothing I can do
Change	39	 Strange fascination, fascinating me
Change	22	 So the days float through my eyes
Space	1	 Ground Control to Major Tom
Space	38	 Can you....
Change	9	 Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Space	0	 Ground Control to Major Tom
Change	44	 Ch-ch-changes
Hero	42	 We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Change	10	 (Turn and face the strange)
Change	24	 And these children that you spit on
Space	21	 For here
Change	21	 Of warm impermanence and
Hero	36	 just for one day
Hero	40	 Just for one day
Space	40	 round my tin can
Hero	5	 And you, you can be mean
Space	28	 I'm feeling very still
Space	33	 Your circuit's dead,
Space	19	 in a most peculiar way
Space	24	 Planet Earth is blue
Hero	43	 Maybe we're lying, 
Space	42	 Planet Earth is blue
Change	11	 Ch-ch-changes
Hero	47	 Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, 
Hero	48	 just for one day
Change	12	 Don't want to be a richer man
Space	10	 This is Ground Control 
Hero	22	 And you, you will be queen
Change	48	 Ch-ch-changes
Hero	16	 Though nothing,
Change	38	 But you can't trace time
Hero	6	 And I, I'll drink all the time
Hero	19	 Oh we can be Heroes, 
Change	23	 But still the days seem the same
Space	36	 Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Change	45	 Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Change	27	 They're quite aware of what they're going through
Hero	39	 We can be Heroes
Hero	37	 We can be Heroes
Hero	27	 Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
Hero	26	 I, I can remember (I remember)
Change	3	 And every time I thought I'd got it made
Hero	35	 Then we could be Heroes, 
Hero	0	 I, I will be king
Change	29	 (Turn and face the strange)
Space	9	 Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff
Hero	7	 'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Change	46	 Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Hero	2	 Though nothing will drive them away
Change	20	 But never leave the stream
Change	8	 I'm much too fast to take that test
Hero	31	 as though nothing could fall
Hero	25	 We can be us, just for one day
Hero	41	 We can be Heroes
Hero	1	 And you, you will be queen
Change	49	 Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Hero	29	 (over our heads)
Change	7	 Of how the others must see the faker
Change	25	 As they try to change their worlds
Space	11	 to Major Tom
Change	17	 Time may change me
Hero	10	 We could steal time, 
Hero	33	 And the shame was on the other side
Hero	11	 just for one day
Change	53	 But I can't trace time
Change	15	 Ch-ch-changes
Hero	32	 (nothing could fall)
Hero	21	 I, I will be king
Hero	3	 We can beat them, just for one day
Change	16	 Just gonna have to be a different man
Hero	46	 just for one day
Change	36	 You've left us up to our necks in it
Hero	8	 Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Change	43	 (Turn and face the strange)
Change	5	 So I turned myself to face me
Change	32	 Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Change	41	 I'm going through
Space	13	 And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Space	29	 And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Space	37	 Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Space	39	 Here am I floating 
Change	47	 (Turn and face the strange)
Change	1	 And my time was running wild
Space	34	 there's something wrong
Change	33	 (Turn and face the strange)
Hero	20	 just for one day
Hero	44	 then you better not stay
Change	6	 But I've never caught a glimpse
Space	27	 one hundred thousand miles
Change	30	 Ch-ch-changes
Hero	34	 Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
Change	42	 Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
Space	2	 Take your protein pills 
Space	12	 You've really made the grade
Change	0	 I still don't know what I was waiting for
Change	37	 Time may change me
Change	14	 (Turn and face the strange)
Change	35	 Where's your shame
Space	8	 and may God's love be with you
Space	23	 Far above the world
Space	30	 Tell my wife I love her very much 
Hero	45	 But we could be safer, 
Space	6	 engines on
Change	34	 Ch-ch-changes
Space	14	 Now it's time to leave the capsule 
Hero	30	 And we kissed, 
Space	3	 and put your helmet on
Hero	14	 I, I wish you could swim
Hero	13	 What d'you say?
Space	41	 Far above the Moon
Space	7	 Check ignition 
Hero	15	 Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Hero	9	 Though nothing, will keep us together
Change	31	 Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Space	16	 This is Major Tom to Ground Control
Change	28	 Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
