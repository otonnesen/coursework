### Sections

#### Purpose

* Coffee cup waste is a huge problem at UVic. With no clear solution with keeping the coffee cups, we propose a study that looks at the feasability and effectiveness of completely getting rid of single use coffee cups and using shared mugs.
* will help UVic reach 75% waste diversion goal and accurately be able to quantify the effect
* reduce the percentage of waste being 20% to lower.
* Get rid of paper cup recycling program

#### Problem description

##### Need

* x% of disposable cups sold on the UVic campus are not diverted, and end up at a landfill

##### Goal

* Transition to 100% sustainable liquid container use at UVic

##### Objectives

* Introduce a new rent-a-mug program similar to those at UBC and Stanford

##### Constraints

* Initial price of mugs
* Replacement price of mugs
* Resistance from consumers

#### Plan of Action

We should include a gant chart that shows when we would do each study
Studies:

* who uses the most paper cups?
* who does not recycle the most?

* When do people drink the most coffee?
* Do they leave campus with the mug?
* Do they care? (what is the price boundary)
* maybe we just start with residence and move from there.

* look at the effectiveness of the current projects/solutions
* look at some examples of other places that have done similar things
* look at:
  * economic:
    * Cost benefit analysis
    * Opprotunity cost
    * short term / long term effects
  * enviroment
    * how much waste paper cup waste could be reduced? (100%)
    * what about the mugs affects on the enviroment?

#### Conclusion
